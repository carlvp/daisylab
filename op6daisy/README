op6daisy is a six-operator FM synthesizer.

* It's straight-forward to set up on breadboard. Relevant pins on Daisy Seed:
  18 Audio Out 1
  19 Audio Out 2
  20 Analog Ground
  40 Digital Ground (Analog and Digital Ground should be connected)
  
* MIDI is passed over USB and Daisy can be powered over USB as well.
  In this set-up Daisy acts as a USB HID device.
  
* It is *not* a DX7 emulator, but sufficiently similar in voice
  architecture for it to be useful load DX7 SysEx (.syx) files
  in the format known as "32 voice bulk dump". Internally, the .syx
  is converted to op6daisys native format.
  
* Due to a current limitation of the implementation in libDaisy,
  the .syx files needs to be chopped up in pieces of at most 128 bytes
  of payload. I will upload a utility (op6-ui) that does that.
  
* At power-up the INIT_VOICE is loaded. It's a rather dull sounding,
  single operator sine wave. There is currently no practical way of
  creating voices yourself -so you'll need some .syx files. These
  are two good places:
  ** http://bobbyblues.recup.ch/yamaha_dx7/dx7_patches.html
  ** https://yamahablackboxes.com/collection/yamaha-dx7-synthesizer/patches
  
* In a addition to SysEx, the op6daisy listens to MIDI note-on/off,
  program change, pitch-bend and controls 7 (channel volume) and
  10 (pan).

* This is a multi-timbral synth. Each of the 16 MIDI channels can have
  a distinct program/patch/voice. But polyphony is very modest (4 voices
  work consistently, 6 don't work at all) -so you won't be able to play
  all 16 sounds at once, anyway.

* I haven't even started looking into optimization, but there is some
  hope that the number of voices can be increased.

* and, yeah, work in progress, I hope to add to this list soon. But I think
  -despite its limitations- it's actually possible to use it as-is.

Hope you like it!
